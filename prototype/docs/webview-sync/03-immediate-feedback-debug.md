# Immediate Feedback and Debug Controls

This document describes the current implementation of:

- **Immediate feedback overlays** (old trace vs new simulated trace when loading XMI)
- **Debugging features** in the WebView (`Pause/Resume`, `Stop`, `Step`, `Skip End`)
- **Immediate Feedback during paused edits** (while debugging): compare already-navigated prefix vs newly predicted path, highlight deviations, and align pegman to the last common point
- **Execution log panel** in the WebView (step-by-step commands shown below the blocks)

It is intended for contributors/agents extending `blocky_game` without breaking sync behavior.

## Where the code lives

- `blocky_game/src/blocky_game/ImmediateFeedbackService.java`
  - Computes old/new path overlays for loaded models.
- `blocky_game/src/blocky_game/DebuggingService.java`
  - Dedicated debugger helpers (trace computation from arbitrary state, debug overlay snippet).
- `blocky_game/src/blocky_game/GameEngine.java`
  - Stores immediate-feedback paths.
  - Holds debugger session state and step/tick methods.
- `blocky_game/src/blocky_game/BlockyUI.java`
  - Injects JS bridge hooks and debug buttons into WebView.
  - Applies map/model state and overlay rendering in WebView.

## Immediate feedback (XMI load)

### Goal

When loading an XMI model, show:

- **Past path**: execution trace stored in the loaded model
- **New path**: re-simulated trace from the currently loaded solution

with distinct colors so changes are visible without manual comparison.

### Flow

1. `BlockyUI` loads XMI via `GameEngine.loadFromFile(...)`.
2. `GameEngine` calls `ImmediateFeedbackService.computePaths(level)`.
3. Engine exposes paths via `getPastPath()` / `getNewPath()`.
4. `BlockyUI.applyLevelToWebView(...)` injects:
   - `window.__injectPastPath`
   - `window.__injectNewPath`
5. Injected JS draws SVG overlays:
   - `pathPast` (red)
   - `pathNew` (green)

### Notes

- `ImmediateFeedbackService` compresses consecutive duplicate positions (turn-only states).
- If a trace is sparse/missing, overlays degrade gracefully to start-cell markers.

## Debug controls

### Goal

Enable step-by-step program debugging directly in WebView:

- `Pause/Resume`
- `Stop`
- `Step` (one state then pause)
- `Skip End` (jump to final state: GOAL/CRASH/INFINITE_LOOP heuristic)

Users can edit blocks while paused; next resume/step recomputes from current state.

### Immediate Feedback during paused edits (debugging)

When a user edits blocks while paused in a debug session and then presses **Resume** or **Step**, the system provides Immediate Feedback by:

- **Past prefix**: the already-navigated path prefix so far
- **New preview**: the newly predicted full path after the edit
- **Deviation highlight**: draw the diverging segment in a different style/color
- **Teleport/alignment**: move pegman to the **last common cell** (path-only match by `(x,y)`)
- **Correct continuation**: resume/step continues from the aligned state, not from statement 1

Implementation notes:

- The alignment happens on **Resume/Step**, not on every workspace change.
- `GameEngine.debugFrameJson()` includes `pastPrefix`, `newPreview`, and `common` (common prefix length) for overlay rendering.
- A one-shot `note` line is emitted into the execution log when such alignment occurs.

### Important design choices

- Debugging is **Java-driven**, not WebView-interpreter-driven.
- During debug stepping, JS sync only updates **program XML**.
  - It intentionally avoids `syncMap` / `syncLevelMeta` to prevent orientation instability from feeding `window.T` back into model metadata.
- Auto-run click after injection is disabled when debug controls are active.
- Run-button observer ignores style changes while a debug session is active.
- On XMI loads, debug start direction seeds from model start orientation (`window.__modelStartT`) instead of Maze reset defaults.

### Engine session state

`GameEngine` maintains:

- `debugTrace`
- `debugIndex`
- `debugPaused`
- `debugDirtySolution`
- current/start `(x,y,dir)` snapshots

Primary methods:

- `debugStart(q,s,t)`
- `debugTogglePause()`
- `debugStepOnce()`
- `debugTick()`
- `debugStop()`
- `debugSkipToEnd()`

`debugFrameJson()` returns UI frame data:

- current position/orientation
- current prefix path
- paused flag
- result status (`RUNNING`, `GOAL`, `CRASH`, `INFINITE_LOOP`)
- current step log line (`logLine`)

## Execution log panel

### Goal

Show comprehensive, step-by-step execution logs directly inside the Maze WebView in the large whitespace **below the blocks** and **above the trashcan**.

This panel is populated for:

- Debugger actions: `Step`, `Resume` (via `debugTick`), `Skip End`, `Stop`
- Normal `Run` execution (Java simulation)

### WebView UI injection

Injected by `BlockyUI.injectDebugControls(...)`:

- `div#__execLogPanel` (container)
- `pre#__execLogBody` (scrollable log output)
- helpers:
  - `window.__execLogClear()`
  - `window.__execLogAppend(linesOrArray)`

The log panel is intentionally implemented as injected DOM/CSS so we don’t have to modify the minified Maze HTML generator.

### Data flow

- **Debugger**:
  - Java computes a trace from arbitrary `(q,s,dir)` via `DebuggingService.computeTraceFromState(...)`.
  - `GameEngine.debugFrameJson()` returns `logLine` aligned with the current trace index.
  - Injected JS appends `fr.logLine` exactly once per new `fr.index` (tracked by `window.__dbgLastLoggedIndex`).
  - If paused edits caused an alignment, `GameEngine.debugFrameJson()` also returns `note` and injected JS appends it once (tracked by `window.__dbgLastNote`).

- **Normal Run**:
  - `JSBridge.runSimulation()` clears the panel then calls `GameEngine.simulateUserProgramWithLogs()`.
  - The returned `List<String>` is appended into the WebView in one batch.

### WebView behavior

Buttons are injected only by:

- default/page load path (`injectDebugControls(...)`)

`applyLevelToWebView(...)` does not create duplicate debug bindings.

Debug overlay is rendered via `DebuggingService.renderDebugOverlayJsSnippet()`.

Current behavior:

- removes green immediate-feedback overlay (`pathNew`) while debugging
- draws a **cumulative** path for all debug steps in the current prefix
- optionally draws **pastPrefix vs newPreview** (Immediate Feedback during paused edits) and highlights deviation
- highlights current cell
- disables `Step`/`Skip End` when a terminal frame is reached (`GOAL`, `CRASH`, `INFINITE_LOOP`)
- uses a step in-flight lock so rapid clicking cannot queue overlapping step calls

## Known caveats

- JavaFX `executeScript(...)` uses large concatenated JS strings; syntax errors can break all injected behavior.
- If adding new JS comments inside injected strings, avoid `//` in single-line contexts; prefer block comments.
- Maven may not be installed in all dev environments; use IDE build diagnostics as fallback.
- WebView script injections are wrapped in Java-side try/catch logging; check `[BlockyUI] inject* failed` lines when load/debug UI appears broken.

## Regression checklist

1. Load default level (no XMI) -> debug buttons appear.
2. Load model from XMI -> immediate feedback red/green overlays appear.
3. Start debugging -> green path is cleared, debug segment appears.
4. On XMI-loaded levels, `debugStart` uses model start orientation (no forced EAST reset).
5. `Step` changes exactly one trace state and pauses.
6. Rapidly clicking `Step` does not skip visual updates or enqueue parallel steps.
7. `Skip End` jumps to final state and pauses.
8. At terminal result, `Step`/`Skip End` are disabled with terminal tooltip.
9. While paused, edit blocks -> next `Step/Resume` uses updated logic from current state.
