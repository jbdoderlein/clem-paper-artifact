# Blocky MOMoT

MOMoT (Marrying Search-based Optimization and Model Transformation Technology) project for the Blocky maze game. It accepts a Blocky XMI model and searches for a **solution program** that reaches the goal with the **least number of changes** (transformation steps) to the model.

## Goal

- **Input**: An XMI file containing a Blocky **Game** (at least one **Level** with a GridMap, START and GOAL cells; solution may be empty or existing).
- **Output**: A transformation sequence that produces a program (sequence of MoveForward/Turn blocks) that reaches the GOAL when simulated.
- **Objective**: Minimize the number of Henshin rule applications (“least number of changes”).

## Docs for agents

When generating or modifying Henshin rules, MOMoT config, or WebView sync (e.g. map editing via UI), use the agent-oriented docs in this repo:

- **Henshin** (`.henshin_text` rules): [docs/henshin/README.md](../docs/henshin/README.md)
- **MOMoT** (`.momot` config): [docs/momot/README.md](../docs/momot/README.md)
- **WebView↔Java sync** (JSBridge, extending the game UI): [docs/webview-sync/README.md](../docs/webview-sync/README.md)

Transformation rules live in **blocky_model** (not in blocky_momot): see `blocky_model/transformations/` and the Project layout below.

## Prerequisites

- **Eclipse IDE** with **PDE** and **EMF** (e.g. [Eclipse Modeling Tools](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)).
- **Henshin** (transformation engine + textual editor) and **Papyrus** (Henshin SDK depends on Papyrus GMF infrastructure).
- **MOMoT 2.0** from the develop update site.
- **blocky_model** in the same workspace (built / EMF code present).
- **Java 21**.

**Recommended:** Load the shared target platform so p2 resolves everything in one step — see [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) §1.2 and open [`releng/blocky-modeling-2026-06.target`](../releng/blocky-modeling-2026-06.target) → **Set as Active Target Platform**.

MoMoT is published from [MOMoT2 `main` / `docs/eclipse`](https://github.com/jku-win-se/MOMoT2/tree/main/docs/eclipse/updates/latest/develop); the p2 URL used in the target is `https://jku-win-se.github.io/MOMoT2/eclipse/updates/latest/develop/`. For manual installation order (Papyrus → Henshin → MoMoT), see [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) §1.3.

## Project layout

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `blocky.momot` | MOMoT configuration (model path, transformations, fitness, algorithms, experiment). |
| `model/input/` | Directory for the input XMI; default file name used in config: **game.xmi**. |
| `src/blocky_momot/BlockySimulator.java` | Headless simulator used by fitness to check if the program reaches the goal. |
| `output/` | Results (objectives, solutions, models) after a run. |

The Henshin rules are in the **blocky_model** project:

| Path (in blocky_model) | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `transformations/add_block_to_empty_slot.henshin_text` | Henshin rules in textual form (add/delete blocks to solution). |
| `transformations/add_block_to_empty_slot_henshin_text.henshin` | Compiled Henshin module (XMI); **must be generated** from the `.henshin_text` file (see below). **blocky.momot** points to this file. |

## Setup

1. **Import the project**  
   In Eclipse: **File → Import → Existing Projects into Workspace** → select the repo root or the `blocky_momot` folder. Ensure **blocky_model** is imported and built. Activate the [target platform](../releng/blocky-modeling-2026-06.target) (or install plug-ins per [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) §1.3) so **Plug-in Dependencies** resolve for `blocky_momot`.

2. **Set the input XMI**  
   - Copy a Blocky Game XMI into `model/input/` (e.g. from **blocky_game/save.xmi** or **load.xmi**) and name it **game.xmi**, or  
   - Use your own XMI and set the path in `blocky.momot` under `search.model.file` (e.g. `file = "model/input/yourfile.xmi"`).

3. **Generate the .henshin file (XMI/XML)**  
   The rules are written in **add_block_to_empty_slot.henshin_text** in the **blocky_model** project. The **add_block_to_empty_slot_henshin_text.henshin** file is the same transformation in **XMI (XML)** format; MOMoT uses the `.henshin` file. To generate it in Eclipse:  
   - Open **blocky_model/transformations/add_block_to_empty_slot.henshin_text** in the **Henshin Text** editor.  
   - Right-click → **Transform to Henshin**.  
   This creates/updates **blocky_model/transformations/add_block_to_empty_slot_henshin_text.henshin**. You can commit that file so the repo contains the XMI. See blocky_model **transformations/README.md** for details.

   **blocky.momot** references this file via `../blocky_model/transformations/add_block_to_empty_slot_henshin_text.henshin` (relative to the blocky_momot project).

## How to run the search

1. Open **blocky.momot** in the MOMoT editor.
2. Run the MOMoT configuration (e.g. Run button or context menu “Run as MOMoT” / equivalent from your MOMoT installation).
3. The search uses the configured algorithms (e.g. Random, NSGA_II) to find transformation sequences that reach the goal and minimize solution length.
4. Results are written under **output/** (objectives, solutions, exported models). You can load the exported XMI models back into **blocky_game** to inspect the solution.

## Configuration summary

- **Fitness**:  
  - **GoalReached** (maximize): 1 if the simulated program reaches the goal, 0 otherwise.  
  - **SolutionLength** (minimize): number of rule applications (“minimal number of changes”).  
  - **MustReachGoal** (constraint): high penalty if the goal is not reached.
- **Algorithms**: Random search and NSGA-II (configurable in `blocky.momot`).
- **Paths** in the config are relative to the project root when run from Eclipse.

## Generating better Henshin and MoMoT files

To avoid common runtime errors and get correct behavior (e.g. empty solution):

1. **Henshin rules (generator / .henshin_text)**  
   - See [docs/henshin/09-generating-henshin-text.md](../docs/henshin/09-generating-henshin-text.md): use **package nsURI** in the compiled .henshin (not Ecore file path), **no IN parameters** if MoMoT won’t set them, and for slots on objects under the root (e.g. `Level.solution`) include **root + containment edge** in the LHS (e.g. `node game`, `node level`, `edges [(game->level:levels)]`).
2. **Compiled .henshin**  
   After each “Transform to Henshin”, replace `../model/blocky.ecore#` with `http://www.example.org/blocky#` in the .henshin file, or run the generator with two args so it rewrites the .henshin (see blocky_model **transformations/README.md**).
3. **MoMoT config**  
   See [docs/momot/05-ecore-henshin-integration.md](../docs/momot/05-ecore-henshin-integration.md): register the Ecore package in **initialization** and in **model.adapt** on the resource set; use **ignoreUnits** for rules that have IN parameters you don’t set.
